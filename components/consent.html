                <h2>General Participant Information About the Study </h2>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your interest in participating in this study conducted by Alexandr Ten, Michiko Sakaki, Kou Murayama, and collaborators at the Hector Institute for Educational Sciences and Psychology of the University of T√ºbingen. In this study, we will ask you to play a guessing game in which you will explore food preferences of fictional monsters. We will also ask you to fill out several questionnaires on your demographic characteristics and your beliefs. Some of you may be asked to complete a second part of the study [DELAY] hours later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To participate in the experiment, you MUST meet the following criteria: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be 18 years of age or older</li>
                        <li>Be a fluent or native speaker of [LANGUAGE]</li>
                        <li>Have never participated in this experiment before</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study will take [DURATION]. After completing the study, you will be reimbursed with [AMOUNT]/hour.

                <h2>Voluntary Nature of the Study and Anonymity</h2>
                <p>
                    We will identify you only by your Prolific ID. If you received a link to the study directly, we will ask you to provide an email address. These identifiers will be saved separately from the experimental data (e.g., demographic information, survey data, performance on the task). These identifiers will be saved separately from your experimental data and we will link your identifiers to your experimental data using an anonymized code. This code will be unrelated to your personal data and cannot be used to directly identify you. We will only use the code to match your personal data with your experimental data if you request that we delete your data and for the purposes of reimbursement. The coding list with your personal data will be stored away securely and deleted 60 days after we process payment for you. After this, your data will be rendered completely anonymous. The anonymized data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years. As long as the coding list exists, you may request that your data be deleted by reaching out to the research team (see contacts below).

                <h2>Data Protection</h2>
                <p>
                    Your participation in the study is completely voluntary. You may withdraw your participation from the study at any time without providing any reasons. Even if you do prematurely withdraw your participation, you are still entitled to compensation corresponding to the time you spent for the study. Data collected during the study and any personal communications we have will be treated confidentially. Project team members who have access to your personal data are also subject to confidentiality and data secrecy. Furthermore, the results of the study will be published anonymously, i.e., the data cannot trace back to you.
