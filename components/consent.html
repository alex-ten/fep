                <h2>General Participant Information About the Study </h2>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your interest in participating in our study. The study is conducted by Alexandr Ten, Michiko Sakaki, Kou Murayama, and collaborators at the Hector Institute for Educational Sciences and Psychology of the University of T√ºbingen. In this study, we will ask you to play a guessing game in which you will explore food preferences of fictional monsters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To participate, you MUST meet the following criteria: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be 18 years of age or older</li>
                        <li>Be a fluent or native speaker of English</li>
                        <li>Have never participated in this experiment before</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The study will take between 50 and 100 minutes in total. After completing the study, you will be paid as indicated on Prolific.

                <h2>Voluntary Nature of the Study and Anonymity</h2>
                <p>
                    We will identify data collected from you only by your anonymized Prolific ID, which cannot be used to directly identify you. We need to store this data temporarily for the purposes of reimbursement. At most 60 days after processing your payment, we will encrypt your Prolific ID making your data completely anonymized. The anonymized data will be stored for a minimum of 10 years. As long as your Prolific ID exists in our records, you may request that your data be deleted by reaching out to the research team (see contacts below). After being anonymized, it will be impossible to trace your data back to you.

                <h2>Data Protection</h2>
                <p>
                    Your participation in the study is completely voluntary. You may withdraw your participation from the study at any time without providing any reasons. Data collected during the study and any personal communications we have will be treated confidentially. Project team members who have access to your personal data are also subject to confidentiality and data secrecy. Furthermore, the results of the study will be published anonymously, i.e., the data cannot be traced back to you.
