# Free Exploration Paradigm with JATOS

Implementing the original Free Exploration Paradigm instance to run with [JATOS v3.7.4](https://github.com/JATOS/JATOS/releases/tag/v3.7.4). Task description can be found in the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26196-w) and on [OSF](https://osf.io/k2yur/).

To run in JATOS do the following:
1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://www.jatos.org/Installation.html) to install JATOS v3.7.4 on your operating system.
2. Start JATOS and open the GUI (see [this tutorial](https://www.jatos.org/Get-started.html) for more information).
3. Import `free_free_exploration_paradigm.jzip` file into JATOS (see [this page](https://www.jatos.org/Deploy-to-a-server-installation.html) for details) and run.

> :warning: Note, if the .jzip file is not one of the latest-change files, the code for the experiment (e.g., in components, styles, or utils) is probably ahead of the exported version un the .jzip.
